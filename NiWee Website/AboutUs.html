      <p>
      The conventional wisdom is that every founder of a new business had to create a business plan first. At NIWEE, we don’t believe that.

      Why work for weeks to end with a static document as thick as the opportunity, that no one reads ?  At NIWEE, we believe that searching for a business model is the primary task of a start-up. From the start, you need to create a ‘minimum viable product’ or ‘service’ and get your proposed customers to share their thoughts. Find out from the beginning if they would buy your product or servioce -- or what modifications would they need to become your customers.  No need to spend time, money and resources on things THAT WILL NOT BENEFIT you from the very start of your entrepreneurship career.

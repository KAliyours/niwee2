    <h2>The Ecosystem Structure</h2>
        <h4> <p>The NIWEE ecosystem’s purpose is to draw together key actors and stakeholders that gravitate toward developing business ventures and innovation, including entrepreneurs, mentors, incubators, sources of talent such as universities, corporations, investors, technologists and artists and supporting services like
            startup savvy law and accounting firms and individual members

            The idea is that each entity in the ecosystem affects and is affected by the others, creating a constantly evolving relationship in which each entity must be respectful of others and be flexible and adaptable to survive as in a biological ecosystem. Co-creating value takes a certain level of respect, trust, intimacy, and most important, an authentic commitment to
            one another’s best interests.

            We welcome Indigenous and non-Indegenous women who are willing to contribute to the
            common good. Women who place cooperation over competition; consensus over control;
            teamwork over hierarchy; and to connect with others and build networks.

          <h6><p>If you are an Indigenous women, a prospective entrepreneur, your challenges may be a little larger, but  they are surmountable
1.	In 2016 we observed a gap existed when it came to Indigenous women with zero experience and a lower level of education but with tremendous interest in launching a small business to improve their economic well-being and that of their family and community. We consulted with a few hundred Indigenous women and groups across Canada using methods including panels, one-on-one consultations; online Foresight methods; polls; scanning of some fifty study reports, and more.

2.	 Women consulted showed a tremendous force of character, they were creative and hard-working, but the unfortunate discovery was that many business owners or self-employed netted in a year the equivalent of a stipend, not a living wage.  After all their efforts and deducting all business operating expenses, their take-home earnings were often less than the minimum wage.

3.	Many women told us they wished they would have had some experience before launching their business.  Those in business for five to ten years or more often told us they regretted not having taken the leap sooner.  Many of the business owners consulted told us that in hindsight  they wished they had been better prepared to go into business.

4.	Examples often cited were their lack of knowledge?

5.	Those consulted indicated that should a new training and coaching program be developed by NIWEE, it should be experiential, practical and reflect Indigenous ways of learning and doing.

6.	Many people have indicated they would welcome  having access to a new entrepreneurship  multidimensional digital space:  made up of networks of  Indigenous communities, academia, Indigenous entrepreneurs, corporations and other business groups. Its goal would be for all members to come together, to share ideas and experiences, to access infomation and knowledge, to discuss ways of seeing and doing.  To learn about each other and for non-Indigenous members to learn about Indigenous cultures.

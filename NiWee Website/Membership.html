  <h4>The Idea Behind a FREE Membership</h4>
  <h6><p>NIWEE’s first goal is to help 100  Indigenous women launch and/or grow a business of their choice in the next 3-years. The average Canadian has recently become aware of the realities of life imposed on Indigenous peoples in decades and centuries past.
In addition to her realities as an Indigenous woman, there is also the deep-rooted gender inequality, and sexist attitudes persisting. It impacts women’s entrepreneurial success.  Ask any entrepreneur, she’ll tell you about the economic and social barriers she faces.
But a saving grace is that we are human, Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. Together we can contribute to eliminating barriers to entrepreneurship for women, reducing economic inequalities and increasing freedom for all women.
</p></h6>
<h6><p>Join the NIWEE ecosystem, access all content, and bring your voice to forums and discussions. Together we’ll share ideas and grow and sustain successful businesses; let’s redefine our future for ourselves, our family and our community.
As members, let’s impose ourselves but two conditions, let’s bring our love for entrepreneurship to our virtual circle with a good heart and respect for each other.
If those conditions are acceptable and if you are interested in business ownership and in the capacity to participate in the economy fully.
Let’s make the world a better place
